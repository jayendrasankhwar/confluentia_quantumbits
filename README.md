Health Report Analysis & Insight Engine
Overview
This project is a web-based tool that takes structured health report data and analyzes it to provide personalized, actionable insights. It serves as a user-friendly interface to interpret complex medical information, such as blood test results, by offering a clear breakdown of key biomarkers, potential health risks, and tailored recommendations.

The tool is built as a single-page HTML application, making it lightweight and easy to use. It's a prototype designed to demonstrate the power of automated health data analysis.

Features
Personalized Data Input: Users can enter their personal information (age, gender, location) and specific health report parameters.

Biomarker Analysis: The system analyzes each health parameter and categorizes it as normal, high, or low based on established medical guidelines for various countries.

Risk Prediction: The application provides a summary of potential health risks and possible disorders based on the entered data.

Actionable Recommendations: Users receive clear, actionable solutions and recommendations tailored to their specific results, complete with external links for further reading.

Customizable Exports: The final report can be exported as a PDF or an image, with the user's name included for a personalized touch.

Intuitive UI/UX: The user interface is designed to be clean, modern, and easy to navigate, with dynamic color-coded sections for quick status checks.

How to Use
Open the file: Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Enter Your Information: Fill in your personal details and the values from your health report. If a specific test is not on your report, simply enter a hyphen (-).

Analyze: Click the "Analyze Report" button to generate your personalized health insights.

View Your Report: The dashboard will display a summary of your health status, potential risks, and a detailed breakdown of your biomarkers.

Export: Use the "Export as PDF" or "Export as Image" buttons to save your personalized report.

Technology Stack
HTML5: For the basic structure and content.

CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS): For modern, responsive styling and layout.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For all application logic, including data validation, analysis, and UI manipulation.

Third-Party Libraries:

html2canvas: Used to take a snapshot of the report for image export.

jspdf: Used to convert the snapshot into a PDF document.

Google Fonts: For a clean and professional font style.

Development and Contributions
This project is a prototype designed to demonstrate a proof-of-concept. The analysis is based on a simplified, rule-based system and should not replace professional medical advice.

This project was built for the Confluentia Hackathon.
